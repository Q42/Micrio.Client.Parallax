# Deploying a new Micrio version

(For admins only)

You need the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured with an R2 API token (set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`). Your Cloudflare account ID must be set via the `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable. The script constructs both the default endpoint (`https://<id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`) and the EU jurisdiction endpoint (`https://<id>.eu.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`) automatically.

You also need write access to the npm repository of `@micrio-parallax/client`.

To publish to both the hosted JS and NPM with an automatic version bump:

```sh
# Make sure you are logged in to NPM
$ npm login
$ pnpm run publish -- --npm --otp [one-time-password-for-npm]
```

After a successful publish, create a new release at https://github.com/Q42/Micrio.Client/releases/new :

1. Create a tag matching the version just published (e.g. `v7.0.1`)
2. Auto-generate release notes and add what has changed
3. Publish the release
4. Commit the post-publish version bumped `package.json` files

To update only the hosted JS, omit `-- --npm`.

## Documentation site

Generated documentation (TypeDoc) is managed via:

```sh
$ pnpm run docs
```

This runs the TypeDoc pipeline defined in `tsconfig.docs.json`.
